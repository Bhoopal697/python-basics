1) Prepare a classification model using Naive Bayes 
for salary data 

Data Description:

age -- age of a person
workclass	-- A work class is a grouping of work 
education	-- Education of an individuals	
maritalstatus -- Marital status of an individulas	
occupation	 -- occupation of an individuals
relationship -- 	
race --  Race of an Individual
sex --  Gender of an Individual
capitalgain --  profit received from the sale of an investment	
capitalloss	-- A decrease in the value of a capital asset
hoursperweek -- number of hours work per week	
native -- Native of an individual
Salary -- salary of an individual


#######Classification model using naive Bayes for salary data#############

At first import all the important libraries.

As given the data is divided into test and train which makes the problem easier.

Load both the datasets.

With string_cloumns converting all the columns into strings.

Then import preprocessing library
using labelEncoder coverting salary catgerical column into binary one 0"s and 1's

age	workclass	education	educationno	maritalstatus	occupation	relationship	race	sex	capitalgain	capitalloss	hoursperweek	native	Salary
0	8	2	1	6	4	6	3	2	1	0	0	39	37	0
1	21	2	11	8	2	4	0	4	1	0	0	49	37	0
2	11	1	7	11	2	10	0	4	1	0	0	39	37	1
3	27	2	15	9	2	6	0	2	1	87	0	39	37	1
4	17	2	0	5	4	7	1	4	1	0	0	29	37	0
5	46	4	14	14	2	9	0	4	1	44	0	31	37	1
6	7	2	15	9	4	7	4	4	0	0	0	39	37	0
7	38	2	5	3	2	2	0	4	1	0	0	9	37	0
8	48	2	11	8	2	6	0	4	1	77	0	39	37	1
9	19	0	9	12	2	0	0	4	1	0	0	39	37	0

As you can see the salary column is converted to 0's and 1's.

Giving trainX ,trainY and textx, testy there values. In other words giving target and independent variables.

 Use gaussianNB and Multinomial function we could find out confusion matrix and accuracy.

At first for the gaussian

Using spred_gnb as ahh class name fit(trainx,trainy) and predict(testx)
we cwould get confusion matrix accuracy.
Confusion matrix accuracy:
  
[[10506   854]
 [ 1937  1763]]
Accuracy 
 79.46879150066401

Then for the multinomial

Using spred_gnb as ahh class name fit(trainx,trainy) and predict(testx)
we cwould get confusion matrix accuracy.

Confusion MatriX Accuracy :
  [[10631   729]
 [ 2583  1117]]
Accuracy 
 77.49667994687915

With result as ahh class name create dataframe of spred_gnb(gaussian)

let me show the first ten results.

        0       
0	0
1	0
2	0
3	1
4	0
5	1
6	0
7	0
8	1
9	0
10	0

With result2 as ahh class name create dataframe of spread_mnb(multinomial)

let me show the first ten results

       0
0	0
1	0
2	0
3	1
4	0
5	1
6	0
7	0
8	1
9	0
10	0

Here 0 indicates <=50k and 1 indicates >50k.
